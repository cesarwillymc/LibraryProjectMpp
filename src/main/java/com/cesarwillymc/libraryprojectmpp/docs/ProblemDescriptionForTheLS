The desktop application should have a database
that stores information about all books, members,
and daily transaction records in our library.
This information should be easily searchable,
allowing the manager to find books based on ISBN
and book title, and have a filters by attributes
such as title, date created, and date updated.
The application should enable students and
faculty members to reserve and checkout books,
while also keeping track of the status of each book,
such as whether it is currently checked out or available.
Library staff should be able to add new books,
remove books, and update information about
existing books using the application.
The application should also provide
to the library staff  go through the information ,
borrow dates, overdue books, and return dates,
regarding the current status of a book copy.
